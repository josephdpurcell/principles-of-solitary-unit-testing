    <p>The proliferation of testing strategies outside of a broadly agreed set of definitions has caused confusion and a waste of effort by choosing the wrong strategy for the goals to accomplish. Let's change that.</p>

    <p>In this session, we will look at one testing strategy: solitary unit testing. We will start by defining it and showing how it differs from other types of testing.</p>

    <p>The majority of our time will be spent looking at principles of solitary unit testing using PHPUnit code examples. This will help solidify our understanding of this strategy, the difference between types of test doubles, and indicators of several test smells.</p>

    <p>We will conclude by showing how this strategy helps you write better, looking at quality metrics and examples of its success in the development community.</p>

    <p>This session might be for you if you are unsure what test doubles are or how they differ, if you're frustrated by slow tests, if youâ€™re doing TDD and having trouble distinguishing between unit and integration testing, or if you want to learn how to write better software.</p>

    <p>The key takeaway from this session will be a thorough understanding of solitary unit testing to help you write better software.</p>
